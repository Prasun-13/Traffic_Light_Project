# Traffic Light Simulation (GVC Project #9)

## Student Details
Name: Prasun Kumar  
Roll No: 29  
Tool Used: Autodesk Maya + Python (maya.cmds)

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To create a **timer-based traffic light simulation** using 3D modeling, shading, and animation inside Autodesk Maya using Python scripting.

---

## 📌 Tools Used
- Autodesk Maya 2024/2025
- Python (maya.cmds)
- Maya Script Editor
- Viewport 2.0 Playblast

---

## 📌 Features Implemented
- Procedural creation of traffic light housing and lights (using Python)
- Custom colored lambert materials (red / yellow / green)
- Incandescence (glow effect)
- Timer-based animation:  
  Green → Yellow → Red → repeat
- Fully keyframed visibility-based light switching
- Easily adjustable timings and cycles
- Clean group hierarchy and re-runnable script

---

## 📌 How to Run
1. Open Autodesk Maya.
2. Open **Script Editor → Python tab**.
3. Paste the contents of `traffic_light.py`.
4. Press the Execute (▶) button.
5. Press play in the timeline to see the simulation.

---

## 📌 Output
- 3D traffic light with glowing colored lights
- Automatic animation cycle
- Playblast demo video (attached separately)
